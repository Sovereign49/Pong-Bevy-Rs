# Pong-Bevy-Rs
This is my pong clone's source code. </br>
It is written in bevy with a few libraries to ease the workflow. any tips are appreciated
--
The app was built with wasm in mind so to run it I have used [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)

To run the app use `trunk build` it will build the server into ./dist

then copy the assets folder into ./dist as well and serve it with your web server of choice (I personally used python)

Have fun!.
